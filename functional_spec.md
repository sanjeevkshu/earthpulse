### 3.3 Human Footprint
The measurable impact of human activity on the planet — covering agriculture, energy, transport, urbanisation, and consumption. Includes case studies, data-driven explainers, and sector-by-sector analysis.

### 3.4 In Action
Profiles of government policy, corporate commitments, NGO programmes, and community-level initiatives working to address environmental challenges. Filterable by region, theme, and actor type (phase 2).

### 3.5 Voices & Research
The editorial hub — long-form articles, opinion pieces, research summaries, and expert interviews. This is the primary destination for repeat visitors and newsletter subscribers.

### 3.6 Take Action
